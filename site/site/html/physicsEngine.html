        SCREENSHOTS
    </h2>
    <p>
        An example of the simulator (the colors are ugly as they are dynamically choosen
        depending on the weight of the objects). The FPS cannot be entirely trusted as
        it is skewed by most frames taking no time and some taking a lot (hundreds of
        milliseconds). The simulation has no smoothing so it jumps a lot, but if it was
        smoothed (for example by pre-buffering a few frames) it would run fast enough to
        be rendered as needed (30 FPS at least). The below simulation has 169 objects
        (165 moving, the other 4 make up the walls).
    </p>

    <p>
        The simulator can handle extremely bunched situations relatively well.
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />

    However it values correct general simulation over exact simulation so it is
    possible for certain objects to temporarily go through each other (such as the
    bottom circle escaping). This is an issue which could likely be resolved with a
    refactoring of the engine to handle intersections better, however it is also
    likely due to the fact that the box &#39;walls&#39; are actually a set of highly packed
    together immobile circles.<br />

        A more complex code example from the physics simulator would be the fundamental function of the entire simulation, the function which determines how long it will take until two circles are within a certain range.
        It originally functioned by determining the squared difference of the positions
        of the points based on the time (ex, the distance squared), and then seeing when
        this would reach the requested value. However in order to optimize it radical
        changes were made to create

        </span> which
        finds this just based on the given values (this code section was optimized to
        the point of almost incomprehensibility as it was a very often run function and
        took up most of the processing time in the application, as indicated by the Red
        Gate profiler).
